# Autodiff Package

This is a package you can use to calculate derivatives using automatic differentiation.

# Broader Impact and Inclusivity Statement

### Broader Impacts and Implcations

Our package and automatic differentiation in general have large implications across several relevant fields.

A large field that takes advantage of automatic differnentiation is machine learning, where frameworks like Flux.jl, Pytorch, and Tensorflow take advantage of these algorithms to solve complex equations efficiently. Machine learning is a powerful tool that must be used ethically and with broader impacts in mind; theoretically, a nefarious party could use our software to aid in an unethical use of ML. Some ethical issues in ML include privacy, bias, and transparency.

On the other had, ML is currently being used to solve some of the world's must challenging and pressing issues, so our software could just as well be put to good, worthwhile use. For example, the recent rise of ChatGPT shows how far AI has come and opens the door for us to wonder how far the technology will progress in the future. It is important for us to recognize the dichotomy of negative and positive impacts of this project and others we develop.

Another important field that automatic differentiation can be applied to is the medical field. An example of this is intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). This is a procedure used to treat patients with cancer or other tumors. IMRT requires optimization using a very precise Jacobian, as can be provided with automatic differentiation, in order to accurately assess the priority that different tissues should be treated with. In this case, an accurate Jacobian can be lifesaving.

Additionally, automatic differentiation can be used in weather modeling. In the case of the MM5 Weather Model, automatic differentiation is used to make a model to make sensitivity predictions and determine the accuracy of the atmospheric predictions. This could likewise be applied to other climate modeling. Therefore, our automatic differentiation project could be used to ensure that weather models are able to provide the most accurate and sensitive predictions as possible, allowing for people to adequately prepare for weather changes, including potentially life threatening natural disasters.

There are many automatic differentiation packages that users can choose from, and users of ours or any others should carefully consider the ethical implications of their own projects as we do here.

### Software Inclusivity

We believe that software inclusivity is of the utmost importance and highly value diversity, equity, and the freedom of use of our project. Because of this, we chose to use the MIT Licence for this package. This allows for users to obtain, use, and modify the software without charge, ensuring that there are no financial barriers to use and that are users are able to be from diverse economic backgrounds. Additionally, the permissions given allowing modification of the software allows from users from diverse backgrounds of all types to contribute their ideas and improvements to the software.

Despite our best attempts to make the software as inclusive as possible, this software, as all software does, still has some limitations to access that we were unable to prevent at this time. Due to the respect we have for diversity and our users, we acknowledge these limitations here and our attempts to lessen them. For one, the software and its documentation is written in English, which could serve as a barrier to international users and those less familiar with the English language. It makes use of Python, which is primarily in English.

Additionally, the software for automatic differentiation, which although the basic principles were explained previously in the document, assumes a basic understanding of derivatives and calculus. This means that a user without sufficient mathematical knowledge may not be able to use the software to its full abilities.

Finally, our value for inclusivity is not limited to the users of this software but also applies to us as we created it. We ensured that all members of the team were encouraged and able to contribute to the project. We worked as a unified team, contributing each of our perspectives and ideas.
