    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Every computer program, at it's most elementary form, can be boiled down to a series of basic arithmetic operations and functions. From the definition of the derivative, we know that we can __always__ calculate it by applying the chain rule repeatedly across the function. Therefore, we can find the derivative of every single function by applying automatic differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation is necessary, because other forms of differentiation (namely, symbolic and numerical) have difficulties with converting a computer program into a single full mathematical expression, which automatic differentiation does not struggle with."

    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of automatic differentiation is to break down complex problems into digestable chunks, but there are a few mathematical concepts you will need to be familiar with to understand our implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### <u>Chain Rule:</u>\n",
    "The Chain Rule is essential when calcluating derivative and is taught in introductory calculus classes around the world. The chain rule is as follows:\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{dy}{du}*\\frac{du}{dx}$$\n",
    "Essentially, when you take the derivative of a function, you must take into consideration the derivatives of its inputs. Giving an example with real numbers:\n",
    "$$y=e^{x^2}$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx}=e^{x^2}2x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### <u>Graph Structure of Calculations:</u>\n",
    "Using a graph structure is a helpful way to visualize a complicated function and the steps that are required to evaluate it. Constructing a graph is simple, and it will be helpful to look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by initalizing the first nodes to our inputs. As we trace across edges between nodes, we evaluate the given functions using the one or more nodes that are the origin(s) of a specific edge. As we make our way across the graph, we will complete all steps needed to evaluate the complicated function and eventually be left with its overall output in the graph's final node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### <u>Elementary Functions:</u>\n",
    "1. A background in functions that are common in mathematics is also necessary to understand this project. Of course, the four elementary functions $+, -, *,$ and $/$ will be present throughout.\n",
    "2. Trigonometric functions are also important to know and understand, these being $sin(x)$ and $cos(x)$. These functions oscilate between $-1$ and $1$ in sinusoidal curves. It might be important to note that:\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dx} sin(x) = cos(x)$$\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dx} cos(x) = -sin(x)$$\n",
    "3. Raising a number to a power is another operations we will need in this project. That includes raising a number to negative powers or a power between $0$ and $1$. Note that variables can exist in either the base (rational powers of $x$) or in the exponent (exponential functions).\n",
    "4. Finally, logaritms might be present in our project. Logrithms have a base and an input. If $b$ is your base, $n$ is your input, and $x$ is your output then:\n",
    "$$x = log_b n$$\n",
    "$$b^x = n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### <u>Constants:</u>\n",
    "The constant $e$, Euler's number, might come up as well. $e\\approx 2.72$ and appears in many functions. For example, $e$ is the base of a natural-log.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant $\\pi$ is also very important. $\\pi \\approx 3.14$"

It is much more efficient when many variables are present. We have bookmarked the node.py file to be used in our implementation. Reverse mode seems to be a more complicated software problem to solve, so our main issue will most likely be working through solutions and ironing out bugs -- we are all confident that we are up to the task.\n",
